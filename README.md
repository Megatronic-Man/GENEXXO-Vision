# The GENEXXO Vision

After 14 years in stealth mode, GENEXXO Vision Limited is emerging with a systematic framework for organizing the internet.

## Overview

In 2011, a simple insight led to a 14-year acquisition strategy: adding "XX" to premium single words created valuable, available .com domains. The result: 10,000+ premium domains spanning every major category of human interest and commerce.
